## Go Types

uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, int8, int16, int32, and int64.8, 16, 32, and 64 tell us how many bits each of the types use. uint means “unsignedinteger” while int means “signed integer.” Unsigned integers only contain positivenumbers (or zero). In addition, there two alias types: byte (which is the same asuint8) and rune (which is the same as int32).
